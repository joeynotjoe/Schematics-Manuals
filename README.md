# Schematics & Manuals
> A repository to collect information and schematics for the music equipment and electronics.

PDF Schematics are often hard to track down, and when you find them, they can be held for ransom at high prices. These instruments are already difficult to work on, so I am adding this here in case anyone else needs it. I'm also going to build up a collection of manuals, since I have those lying around as well.

### If you are in possession of other related schematics or manuals, let's expand this repository!
